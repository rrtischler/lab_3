 *---------mmc_sd_setup.c---------
 * This example initializes the MMC controller and reads data from the CSD
 * depending on whether an MMC or SD card is chosen 
 * This example is written for c5509. To run on c5509a, link in the
 * c5509a CSL library and define CHIP_5509A in the build options
 */

/* What we do in this example.
 *
 * The MMC Controller supports both an MMC and an SD card. During the initialization, 
 * we first check if the card is an SD card and initialize accordingly. Then onwards,
 * a sequence of instructions is to be passed to traverse it's state machine and bring
 * it to a data transfer state. The MMC and SD card initialization sequence varies when
 * it comes to the Relative Card Address, which is used by the host to communicate with
 * a particular card. The MMC card has to be sent an RCA from the host, while the SD card
 * publishes it's own RCA and sends it to the host. 
 *
 * NOTE: The EVM5509 MMC Controller can be operated only in the Native mode. Support for
 * SPI mode is now obsolete and the MMC CSL source has been modified accordingly.
 *
 * Data Structures used-
 *   - MMC_Handle : 
 *                  Structure that contains information about the device chosen. 
 *                  Important fields are eventId (CPU interrupt line for MMC device),
 *                  MMC ISR Dispatcher address to be plugged as ISR for the MMC,
 *                  pointer to MMC registers and a pointer to the call back table 
 *                  holding functions, one of which is called when the ISR is hit 
 *                  (the interrupt example offers more explanation on MMC interrupts)
 *
 *   - MMC_CardObj : 
 *                  Structure that holds information about the card. Important fields
 *                  are rca (Relative Card Address), manufacturer's card ID and pointers
 *                  to an MMC CSD structure and an SD CSD structure, one of which will
 *                  be used based on which card is being accessed.
 *
 *   - MMC_CardIdObj :
 *                  Structure that holds the manufacturer's Card Id present on the card.
 *                  This information is read-only.
 *
 *   _ MMC_CardCsdObj :
 *                  Structure that holds the card specific data provided on an MMC Card.
 *                  This information is read-only.
 *
 *   - SD_CardCsdObj :
 *                  Structure that holds the card specific data provided on an SD Card.
 *                  This information is read-only.
